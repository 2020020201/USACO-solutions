# Block Game

## 题目描述
```c++
Farmer John is trying to teach his cows to read by giving them a set of N spelling boards typically used with preschoolers (1≤N≤100). Each board has a word and an image on each side. For example, one side might have the word 'cat' along with a picture of a cat, and the other side might have the word 'dog' along with a picture of a dog. When the boards are lying on the ground, N words are therefore shown. By flipping over some of the boards, a different set of N words can be exposed.
To help the cows with their spelling, Farmer John wants to fashion a number of wooden blocks, each embossed with a single letter of the alphabet. He wants to make sufficiently many blocks of each letter so that no matter which set of N words is exposed on the upward-facing boards, the cows will be able to spell all of these words using the blocks. For example, if N=3 and the words 'box', 'cat', and 'car' were facing upward, the cows would need at least one 'b' block, one 'o' block, one 'x' block, two 'c' blocks, two 'a' blocks, one 't' block, and one 'r' block.
Please help the Farmer John determine the minimum number of blocks for each letter of the alphabet that he needs to provide, so that irrespective of which face of each board is showing, the cows can spell all N visible words.

## 输入
```c++
Line 1 contains the integer N.
The next N lines each contain 2 words separated by a space, giving the two words on opposite sides of a board. Each word is a string of at most 10 lowercase letters.
```

## 输出
```c++
Please output 26 lines. The first output line should contain a number specifying the number of copies of 'a' blocks needed. The next line should specify the number of 'b' blocks needed, and so on.Ⅰ
```

## 题目翻译
```c++
农夫约翰正试图教他的牛阅读，给他们一套通常用于学龄前儿童（1≤N≤100）的拼写板。每个板的每一面都有一个单词和一个图像。例如，一块可能有“猫”这个词和一张猫的图片，另一块可能有“狗”这个词和一张狗的图片。当木板放在地上时，会显示N个单词。通过翻转一些拼写板，可以暴露出一组不同的N个单词。

农夫约翰想用一个木制的字母来帮助他们拼字。他希望每个字母都有足够多的积木，这样无论哪一组N个单词暴露在向上的黑板上，奶牛都能用这些积木拼出所有这些单词。例如，如果N=3，并且单词“box”、“cat”和“car”朝上，奶牛至少需要一个“b”块、一个“o”块、一个“x”块、两个“c”块、两个“a”块、一个“t”块和一个“r”块。

请帮助农场主约翰确定他需要提供的字母表中每个字母的最小方块数，这样，无论每张板显示的是哪一面，奶牛都可以拼出所有N个可见的单词。
